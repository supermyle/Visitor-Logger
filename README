Final Project
Programing for IT
Author @Supermyle
=================

Project Description: This project uses python to scan access log(s) on a cron job but can also
be invoked manually anytime. The data gathered from the access log(s) are put into a JSON file 
on the server root to be scanned with AJAX by the website https://megadatagames.com for the purpose
of displaying a count of visitors on the front page and the time that count was last updated.
Using crontab the default settings are to run visitor_logger.py every 10 minutes.
The python program will also create a stats.log file in the program's current directory if it 
doesn't already exist and append the amount of visitors to that file and log the time the 
cron job was run so the server admin can look at the stats.log file to see how many unique users
were on the website at each execution of the script.
